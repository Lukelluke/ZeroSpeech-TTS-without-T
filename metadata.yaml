system description:
  Our method is fairly unique and original, we first learn a mapping from 
  speech to discret linguistic units in an unsupervised end-to-end setting.
  After projecting all speech to a set of common discrete units,
  then we use adversarial training to learn and improve our model's performance of voice conversion between different speakers.
  We will describe our method in detail by submitting a paper to the Interspeech 2019 Special Workshop,
  using the author names provided above.
